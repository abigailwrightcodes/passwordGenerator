# Password Generator


## Description
An app that allows the user to create a randomized password. Allowing customisation of password length and numbers, letters and symbold to be included.

I have currently been able to create a function that prompts the user to input a password length. This function then identifies if the length meets the required critera of between 8-128 characters.

I have then created an if else statement which identifies which characters the user would like included within their password and create a new array according to the selections

## My next steps:

Use math.floor and math.random to create a for loop which will identify random numbers (according to user input of password length) the random numbers will then be used to pull numbers from the array i created from user selection
